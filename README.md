# Blastocystis_STs_P

Blastocytis is an intestinal protist that presents worldwide distribution and colonizes animal and human hosts. It is also genetically diverse and has been classified into at least seventeen ribo-somal subtypes (STs), although, there are reported novel subtypes from 18 through 32 lately. 

We conducted an update based on studies reporting Blastocytis positive samples in the Americas obtained from diverse hosts. We described the distribution throughout the continent by assem-bling maps, representing the distribution of STs and the most important 18S alleles. Thirty-nine articles from the previous study "A summary of Blastocystis subtypes in North and South America" and forty-one additional articles from March 2019 to March 2022 were considered. We assembled and updated geographically and molecularly the distribution of Blastocystis in the Americas, we hope this delivers new understandings and knowledge of the prevalence and genetic diversity of this microorganism.
